# To-do / future enhancements:
* Implement a 'run' script for Windows (.bat file).
* Make the detector show original images (not the preprocessed versions).
* Make the image recognition accurate and actually working in most cases by using contours of the suit/rank symbols in the training and live/test data
* Make a better 'settings' file (not .py but .json, .cfg, etc).
* Implement better process synchronisation, eg: signal interrupts, sockets, process pipes, etc.
* Solve the Solitaire game automatically by moving the cards and detecting changes from the screenshots *(original idea)
